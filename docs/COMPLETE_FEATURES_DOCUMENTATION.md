## 2. Multi-Tenancy Architecture

### Tenant Isolation
Each business (tenant) operates in complete isolation:
- Separate subdomain (e.g., `business.platform.com`)
- Optional custom domain (e.g., `www.business.com`)
- Isolated data storage
- Independent branding and configuration

### Tenant Context
\`\`\`typescript
interface Tenant {
  id: string
  name: string
  slug: string
  subdomain: string
  custom_domain?: string
  logo_url?: string
  status: 'active' | 'suspended' | 'trial'
  subscription_id: string
  created_at: Date
}
\`\`\`

### Middleware Routing
- Extracts tenant from subdomain or custom domain
- Injects tenant context into all requests
- Enforces tenant-scoped queries
- Protects super admin routes
